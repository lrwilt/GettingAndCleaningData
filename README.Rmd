run_analysis.R takes data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0. This script combines all test, train and subject data;
isolates all mean and standard deviation related variables; and creates a summary table on the mean of each variable grouped by acitivity label and subject.

More details on the experiment can be found at: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>.
